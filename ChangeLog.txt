	* ADD:		A new package called org.macroing.image4j.film has been added. It contains a Film class that represents a camera film. It collects color samples and renders them to an Image instance.
	* ADD:		A new package called org.macroing.image4j.filter has been added. It contains an abstract Filter class and a few implementations. These are used for image reconstruction.

	* ADD:		A new package called org.macroing.image4j.spectralcurve has been added. It contains an abstract SpectralCurve class and a few implementations. They are used for sampled or analytic spectral data.
	* ADD:		A new XYZColor class has been added.
	* CHANGE:	The RGBColorSpace has been changed slightly. The methods convertRGBToXYZ and convertXYZToRGB have new signatures. Instead of referring to the CIE XYZ color as a Color, it is referred to as an XYZColor.

	* CHANGE:	Update version to 0.0.2.
	* CHANGE:	Move functionality provided by this library to Math4J. Most of these changes are internal. Except for the classes Angle and NoiseGenerator. These are now called AngleF and NoiseGeneratorF and can be found in Math4J.
	* CHANGE:	Add a dependency to a new library called Math4J.

	* ADD:		The Image class has two new methods to set a Color given a pixel representation (X- and Y-coordinates or index). These are setColor(int, Color, PixelOperation) and setColor(int, int, Color, PixelOperation).
	* ADD:		The Image class has two new methods to add a Color sample given a pixel representation (X- and Y-coordinates or index). These are addColorSample(int, Color, PixelOperation) and addColorSample(int, int, Color, PixelOperation).
	* ADD:		The Image class has two new methods to get a Color given a pixel representation (X- and Y-coordinates or index). These are getColor(int, PixelOperation) and getColor(int, int, PixelOperation).
	* ADD:		A PixelOperation enum has been added that defines various operations that can be performed on a pixel. The current operations are no-change and wrap-around.
	* CHANGE:	Optimized the update(Function) and update(Function, int, int, int, int) methods in the Image class. Using String.format(String, Object[]) in a loop is a bad idea.
	* CHANGE:	The behavior for the methods setColor(int, Color) and setColor(int, int, Color) in the Image class have changed. They no longer wrap around.
	* CHANGE:	The behavior for the methods addColorSample(int, Color) and addColorSample(int, int, Color) in the Image class have changed. They no longer wrap around.
	* CHANGE:	The behavior for the methods getColor(int) and getColor(int, int) in the Image class have changed. They no longer wrap around.

	* ADD:		A few implementations of PixelFunction have been added. They return a Color by computing Barycentric coordinates and interpolating, returning a constant Color or by computing Simplex-based fractional Brownian motion (fBm) noise.
	* ADD:		Add new construction methods to the Image class. Some of them are toImage(BufferedImage), toImage(int, int, byte[]) and toImage(int, int, byte[], ArrayComponentOrder).
	* ADD:		Add new overloaded methods for drawCircle(...), drawLine(...), drawRectangle(...), drawTriangle(...), fillCircle(...) and fillRectangle(...) to the Image class, that takes a PixelFunction as parameter argument.
	* ADD:		Add a new method fillTriangle(int, int, int, int, int, int, Color, Color, Color) to the Image class.
	* ADD:		Add a new method fillTriangle(int, int, int, int, int, int, PixelFunction) to the Image class with an actual implementation.
	* CHANGE:	The methods fillTriangle(int, int, int, int, int, int) and fillTriangle(int, int, int, int, int, int, Color) of the Image class did not have an implementation. They now do.

	* ADD:		Add a new NoiseGenerator class that can generate noise based on the Perlin- and Simplex noise algorithms.

2019-08-29  Jörgen Lundgren  <joergen.lundgren@macroing.org>

	* ADD:		Add a new TODO.txt file that will contain a list of things to do.
	* ADD:		Add this ChangeLog.txt file to keep track of the progress.
	* ADD:		Add support for changing the resolution of an instance of the Image class.
	* ADD:		Add a new ConvolutionKernel55 class and a multiply(ConvolutionKernel55) method to the Image class.
	* ADD:		Add a new drawImage(int, int, Image, BiFunction) method to the Image class, that allows for different types of blending.
	* ADD:		Add support for various tone mapping operators. These include a few different filmic curve and Reinhard implementations.
	* ADD:		Add support for gamma correction using different RGB color spaces.
	* CHANGE:	Change the drawImage(int, int, Image) method of the Image class to support simple alpha blending.

	* ADD:		Add support for building the project with Apache Ant.
	* ADD:		Add the entire library.
