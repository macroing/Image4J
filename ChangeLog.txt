	* ADD:		A few implementations of PixelFunction have been added. They return a Color by computing Barycentric coordinates and interpolating, returning a constant Color or by computing Simplex-based fractional Brownian motion (fBm) noise.
	* ADD:		Add new construction methods to the Image class. Some of them are toImage(BufferedImage), toImage(int, int, byte[]) and toImage(int, int, byte[], ArrayComponentOrder).
	* ADD:		Add new overloaded methods for drawCircle(...), drawLine(...), drawRectangle(...), drawTriangle(...), fillCircle(...) and fillRectangle(...) to the Image class, that takes a PixelFunction as parameter argument.
	* ADD:		Add a new method fillTriangle(int, int, int, int, int, int, Color, Color, Color) to the Image class.
	* ADD:		Add a new method fillTriangle(int, int, int, int, int, int, PixelFunction) to the Image class with an actual implementation.
	* CHANGE:	The methods fillTriangle(int, int, int, int, int, int) and fillTriangle(int, int, int, int, int, int, Color) of the Image class did not have an implementation. They now do.

	* ADD:		Add a new NoiseGenerator class that can generate noise based on the Perlin- and Simplex noise algorithms.

	* ADD:		Add a new TODO.txt file that will contain a list of things to do.
	* ADD:		Add this ChangeLog.txt file to keep track of the progress.
	* ADD:		Add support for changing the resolution of an instance of the Image class.
	* ADD:		Add a new ConvolutionKernel55 class and a multiply(ConvolutionKernel55) method to the Image class.
	* ADD:		Add a new drawImage(int, int, Image, BiFunction) method to the Image class, that allows for different types of blending.
	* ADD:		Add support for various tone mapping operators. These include a few different filmic curve and Reinhard implementations.
	* ADD:		Add support for gamma correction using different RGB color spaces.
	* CHANGE:	Change the drawImage(int, int, Image) method of the Image class to support simple alpha blending.

	* ADD:		Add support for building the project with Apache Ant.
	* ADD:		Add the entire library.
